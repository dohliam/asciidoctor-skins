== Encrypt your Secrets

```
$ mvn --encrypt-master-password
Master password: *********
{encrypted_master_password}
```

Store this in `~/.m2/settings-security.xml`

```xml
<settingsSecurity>
 <master>{encrypted_master_password}</master>
</settingsSecurity>
```
Now encrypt your server password:

```
mvn --encrypt-password
Master password: *********
{encrypted_password}
```

Store this in your `settings.xml` file as follows:

```xml
<server>
 <id>my.server</id>
 <username>smaple</username>
 <password>{encrypted_password}</password>
</server>
```

== Don't use passwords in the CLI

Never enter passwords in plain text on the CLI:

[source,sh,role=dont]
----
$ mvn --encrypt-master-password P@ssw0rd

$ mvn --encrypt-password P@ssw0rd
----

== Always Use HTTPS

Use HTTPS to connect to remote Maven repositories, to avoid MITM attacks.

Ensure your `<repositories>` and `<pluginRepositories>` use https in their URLs.

== Check Dependency Health

Verify the health of your third-party libraries by confirming they have:

[.do]
* [x] A team of committers
* [x] Well documented security policies
* [x] Regular updates and releases

== Test for Known Vulnerabilities

Do not use Maven dependencies with known vulnerabilities. +
Use a tool like Snyk to:

[.do]
* [x] Test your app for known vulnerabilities.
* [x] Automatically fix issues that exist.
* [x] Continuously monitor for new vulnerabilities

== Test your Checksums

As part of validating the authenticity of your dependencies,
test their checksums using the -C flag on Maven commands:

```
$ mvn -C install
// fail if checksums don’t match

$ mvn -c install
// warn if checksums don’t match
```

== Don't use Properties for Passwords

Never store your secrets in your pom.xml properties.

[source,xml,role=dont]
----
<properties>
  <my.property>P@ssw0rd</my.property>
</properties>
----

== Use Maven developers/roles

Use Maven roles to state who should be contacted for security issues.

```xml
<developers>
 <developer>
   <id>grander</id>
   <name>Danny Grander</name>
   <email>security@your_org.com</email>
   <roles>
     <role>security</role>
   </roles>
 <developer>
<developers>
```

== Stay up-to-date

Try to stay on the latest releases of Maven. Check the download page for the latest version.

Avoid Maven 3.0.4 as it ignores certificates for HTTPS connections.

== Check Security Bulletins

Monitor the security bulletins the Apache Maven team publish on the
https://maven.apache.org/security.html[Maven site].
